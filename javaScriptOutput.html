        <h2>JavaScript Display Possibilities</h2>
        <blockquote>
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
<blockquote>
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
1.innerHTML
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</script>
2.using document.write()
<p>Never call document.write after the document has finished loading.
    It will overwrite the whole document.</p>
    
    <script>
    document.write(5 + 6);
    </script>
<button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it content will be deleted</button>
    3.using windoes.alert()


<h2>First Web Page</h2>
<p> first paragraph.</p>

<script>
window.alert("mesaage appear in a box");
</script>
<h2>We can skip window keyword in windows.alert()</h2>
4.using console.log()
For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.
JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.

You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.

The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

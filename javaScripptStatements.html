        <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
        <blockquote>
            A <b>JavaScript program</b>is made up of <b>Statements</b>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.
<br>
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
<br>
JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.
<br>
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended
<br><br><br>
JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
    function bufun(){
        document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML="Hello Mandeep";
        document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML="How Are you?"
    }
</script>
<button type="button" onclick='bufun()'>CLICK Me</button>
<br><br><br>
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.
